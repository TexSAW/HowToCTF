# The Night Before the CTF

_'Twas the night before the CTF and not a creature was stirring, save for an infrastructure team lead_

The night before the CTF, there are some tasks that need to be done to ensure the competition goes smoothly.

First and foremost walking into the room that the CTF is scheduled to be in and visually confirming that the room is setup as it needs to be is a must.  This includes making sure that the right number of tables and chairs are present, making sure that there is sufficient power available in the form of power strips or outlets, and making sure that any temporary tables have been loaded into the room, or at least that the places they will go are clear.

With the room in good condition, its time to check the technical components of the CTF.  If using vSphere, this is the time to make a snapshot of the servers so that if something goes wrong its possible to restore to this point.  The machines should all be kept running if possible through to the start of the CTF if using physical machines.  If using virtual machines, the machines can be paused, but should not be shut down if it can be avoided.

Assuming that the checklists are all green through to this point, the final electronic system to be checked is the A/V system for the room.  Verify that any cables needed are present and work to connect the machine that will be showing the scoreboard.  Verify that if microphones will be in use that they are present and that they have batteries if applicable.  Normally this will all be done by Media Services or equivalent, but it never hurts to double check.

Now that all the systems are checked and the room is ready to go the final step is to ready people for the next day.  Nominate someone who will be the primary point of contact for contestants and make sure they understand what this entails.  This person may need to diffuse a situation where a technical issue has causes a change in ranking.  Make sure that everyone knows how issues will be handled and what the official statements will be.  Make sure that the rules for competition are on hand and have been agreed upon so that everyone gives the same answers to questions.

With everyone satisfied that the contest is ready to go, it is time to go home and sleep.  This seems like a silly thing to write in this guide, but one of the biggest issues of TexSAW wound up being related to the infrastructure team not getting enough sleep on the first day and as a result not being as alert as possible when problems arose.

*Before everyone goes home, make sure that everyone is aware of when they need to be back on site the next morning.*
