# The Day Of

The day of the CTF can be hectic and stressful.  The single most important thing to do is to keep a cool head and not reveal unintentionally any information about the status of the competition.  All information going to contestants should be coming from the nominated person.  This really helps to make sure there is always consistent information going out.

Make sure that all competition staff are able to sit together.  Ideally this will be located next to the table where the routing gear is located.  This table should be far enough away that if the staff needs to talk in hushed voices they will not be overheard, but it should be close enough to the main competition area to keep an eye on things and to be available to answer questions.

Make sure that the CTF scoreboard is up on a projector.  Besides motivating people to do well, it is great for everyone to be able to look at and get an at-a-glance idea of how the competition is doing.  In the event of a server outage, the outage will be obvious by the scoreboard suddenly 404-ing.  If you're using monit be sure to have that in another tab as well so that its possible to jump over to it and show everyone that things are still working.

Keep in touch with event staff and make sure that they are kept in the loop about any schedule adjustments that need to be made.  This goes doubly so for if lunch needs to be moved due to a delay.

After the CTF concludes, print out the scoreboard results and store them somewhere secure.  Make sure the time printed is on the results.  Its very important to also speak with every competitor and get feedback on how the competition went.  There may be issues that weren't noticed or weren't critical enough to bring up during the day.  This should be done on paper or via an electronic survey and should almost certainly be done anonymously.

While tearing down make sure that the room is put back in good condition.  This involves making sure that all chairs are pushed in and that tables are clear.  Projectors should be turned off and loaned media gear should be returned.  Cables that are borrowed should be returned to the rightful owners as soon as possible and other competition gear should be returned to the correct groups.

After everything is down its a good idea to go get food as a group.  This ensures that everyone has a moment to be away from the context of the event and to part on good terms.  This isn't specific to a CTF and is more just general project management, but its still something important that is often missed.
