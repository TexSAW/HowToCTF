# After the Event

After all is said and done and the dust has settled, its time to reflect back and write down what worked and what didn't and to discuss what didn't work as well as it could have.  This process should happen at least 2 days after the CTF but not more than a week after.  Writing everything down needs to happen while its still fresh in everyone's mind but needs to happen with enough delay that people have time to digest the information and collect their thoughts on what went well and what didn't.

After the write-up is complete its time to release the last sets of resources that are in use by the competition.  This includes spinning down the VMs that ran the competition servers and exploitable challenge servers.  In general its not a good idea to keep the servers themselves around, pull whatever data was of value from the server and then de-provision the VM.  In the case of physical servers they should be returned to a blank image ready for the next event to need the hardware.  After cleanup there should be no vulnerable code left running from the CTF.

Its not uncommon to also have collected a small pile of business cards during the CTF.  After the CTF is the time to reach out to these people and thank them for their participation and any resources they may have provided.
