# Trivia

Trivia possibly one of the most important categories. Primarily, it (hopefully) insures no team actually trying scores zero points. Secondarily, it can buy you time while other problems are down, as contestants can busy themselves with trivia as you work to fix an outage. Some of the best trivia comes from hacker cult classics (HACK THE PLANET!) and otherwise ridiculous jokes and quotes can help keep the mood of the CTF light. Trivia related to the hosting entity (The University of Texas at Dallas, in our case) can also be included, to further extend your branding on the event.
