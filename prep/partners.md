# Partners in Crime

Internal partners are almost as important if not more so as external partners in providing a successful CTF.  Internal partners are able to work with specific knowledge of the institution that is hosting the CTF and are able to contribute resources that otherwise might not be readily available.  For our CTF we had 3 internal partners that were of exceptional help.  These organizations are likely to exist at other schools and to anyone looking to duplicate our success we highly recommend reaching out to these organizations.

In alphabetical order:


## Computer Science Technical Support

Our CS Tech group was instrumental in making sure that we had network access in a VLAN that was acceptable to run a conference in.  Additionally they were instrumental in troubleshooting our routing black hole.  Without the support of the full time staff, our infrastructure would not have been nearly as stable.


## Computer Security Group

Our CSG is a student group focused on advocating for security and education.  Since the group often works with exploitable challenges and competes in CTFs, this was an excellent source of information for what makes a good CTF.  Additionally, the CSG maintains a secure a vSphere environment where we were able to host the CTFd instance and problem server for challenges that required server components.


## Linux Users Group

The LUG at UTD focuses on Open Source software and use of Linux.  Since most CTFs tend to be hosted on Linux servers, this is a natural choice to involve the LUG.  The LUG was able to reach out and assist with configuring the servers with a large amount of modular Ansible, as well as provide physical hardware for setting up the LAN used during the conference.  This hardware was already owned by the LUG and would have been an unnecessary expense if bought by the conference.

Producing a successful CTF involves getting all people involved to provide their best work.  This often includes seeking out people who have specialized knowledge as was done with TexSAW.
