# Team Management

A CTF is virtually impossible to put on with a single person.  There are certain processes that work better when handled in parallel and there are times where its best to swallow one's pride and go find an expert.

One of the most important things to do early on is to clearly define teams and assign people to these teams with clear responsibilities.  This includes making sure that everyone knows that they are responsible for and who they report to.  It sounds simple, but also making sure that people exchange contact information is an important step.

As far as managing the process goes, we used Google Docs and Trello, though any shared document solution can be used in place of Google Docs as long as it has some kind of spreadsheet editor.  Trello is a digital KanBan board system that allows at-a-glance status updates for where components in a process are.  We used states such as "To Do", "Doing", "On Hold", and "Done" to track various components of the CTF as they moved torwards completion.  Each card on the board also had a person listed who was responsible for the content of the card with an email address to contact in the case the card was falling behind.
